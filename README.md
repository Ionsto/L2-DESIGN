## GIT
How to use git for dummies:

https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/

The general idea is that you:
 - *PULL* at the start of work, make some changes locally
 - *ADD* only the key changed files
 - *COMMIT* changes with a descriptive commit message 
 - *PUSH* to give everybody else your changes

You should aim to do small and often commits vs large dumps of changes.
This allows merges to happen easier, and makes everybody life easier.

The Git workflow:

The heart of the git system is commits, they are your changes, and they have messages describing what youve done.

Compiled markup language, the compiler can be easily installed via TexMaker.
