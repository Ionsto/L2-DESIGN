Wheels Section
Many factors affect the choice of wheels ‚Äì rolling resistance is affected by the materials of the
wheels and bearings, with the ability to transfer power dependent on the radii and material of the
driven wheels.
Commercial longboard wheels are typically made from polyurethane, with construction normally
consisting of a hardened plastic core with the outer layers and surface of polyurethane. This material
achieves a Œºrolling in the range of 0.04-0.08 ‚Äì while this is sufficiently small to provide low rolling
resistance, polyurethane also only provides a Œºstatic of ~0.2, limiting the amount of torque than can
be transferred from the motor to road surface. This can be ameliorated by using rubber for the
driven wheels as rubber achieves a Œºstatic in the range of 0.35-0.45, allowing for an increase in torque
transmitted of 75-125%.
Bearing materials for longboard wheels come in three different material families: steel, titanium and
ceramic. Whilst exact values of frictional resistance are difficult to find, comparisons can be
extrapolated from their material properties. Ceramic (Silicon Nitride) has a Brinell hardness 1479
kg/mm2, an increase of approx. 640% over that of AISI 52100 steel and ASTM 7 Titanium 1. This would
suggest much less energy lost from elastic deformation. However, Silicon Nitride also exhibits a yield
strength of 170MPa: approx. 64% less than steel and titanium. As such ceramic may be unadvisable
as the board will be used in an environment not dedicated to skateboarding and is likely to suffer
various shocks. Additionally, ceramic bearings cost significantly more than steel and titanium, the
former often in the $90-$150 range, as opposed to $15-$20 and $30 mark for steel and titanium
respectively. Due to the similar properties of steel and titanium bearings, the latter‚Äôs corrosion
resistance may suggest that it is the optimal of the three, increasing savings in the long-run by
requiring less maintenance.
Longboard wheels typically vary in diameter between 60-100mm with a contact patch width of
‚âà30mm ‚Äì the size of wheel can be selected to provide the required torque at ground, with the
relevant calculations shown below.
