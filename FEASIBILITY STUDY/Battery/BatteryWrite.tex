\section{Overview}
The largest and bulkiest device on any electrical vehicle is the battery.
Dense energy storage is a difficult task, and batteries are a must for almost all devices.
\section{Capacity}
The larger the capacity of a battery network, the larger, heavier, and more expensive the battery network becomes.
The use case of the system needs to be considered for chosing a capacity.
Capacitance is normally measured in Amp-Hours, or how many hours a battery can supply the rated current at the nominal voltage of the battery.
\section{Charging}
Battery charging is difficult, specific charging circuits are needed for most modern high density batteries.
When trying to charge lots of batteries quickly a large amount of heat is generated, which needs to be considered in the design stage.
Large modern batteries can also be very dangerous - and this is amplified when charging, so care needs to be taken that the design isn't a health hazard.
