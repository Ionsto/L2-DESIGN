#Battery picked
Two 6S batteries are more affordable to find, and allow for the batteries to be placed in disparate locations
There is also the thermal dissapation benifits for having two seperate batteries.
We picked this battery as it has roughly half the capacity that we need

Watt hour capcity: 177.6Wh each
2 batteries in parallel, 355.2Wh

Since we have two seeprate batteries that are being used in parralel, we will either need a charger that can handle a 12S system or we will have to do some TDMA parralel charging.

#Battery charging mode 
When in operation, the  batteries are in series to get the correct operating voltage, but for charging they need to be in parralel for the charger to work.
